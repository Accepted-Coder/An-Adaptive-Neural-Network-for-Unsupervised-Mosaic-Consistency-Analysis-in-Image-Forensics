Requirements:

train_model.py


# Usage

###Â Train or retrain a network
train_model.py [-h] [-m MODEL] [-j JPEG] [-b BLOCK_SIZE] [-o OUT]
                      [-l LEARNING_RATE] [-a EPOCHS_AUXILIARY]
                      [-B EPOCHS_BLOCKWISE] [-s BATCH_SIZE]
                      input [input ...]
To use a pretrained network and retrain it on data, specify the pretrained model with -m.
All images are kept in GPU memory at the same time. As a consequence, training on a large database require more GPU memory.

### Detect forgeries on a single image with the proposed method
detect_forgeries.py [-h] [-m MODEL] [-j JPEG]
                                    [-o OUT]
                                    [-b BLOCK_SIZE]
                                    input
The model can be specified with -m. By default, uses the pretrained model (not retrained on the database).
If the output image path is not specified, results will be plotted interactively.

### Detect forgeries on multiple images with the intermediate values method:
choi_intermediate_values.py [-h] [-j JPEG] [-b BLOCK_SIZE] [-o OUT]
                                   input [input ...]
This is an implementation of the method described in
Choi, C., Choi, J., & Lee, H. (2011). CFA pattern identification of digital cameras using intermediate value counting. MM&Sec'11.

### Detect forgeries on multiple images with the variance of colour difference method:
shin_variance.py [-h] [-j JPEG] [-b BLOCK_SIZE] [-o OUT]
                        input [input ...]
This is an implementation of the method described in
Hyun Jun Shin, Jong Ju Jeon, and Il Kyu Eom "Color filter array pattern identification using variance of color difference image," Journal of Electronic Imaging 26(4), 043015 (7 August 2017). https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JEI.26.4.043015
